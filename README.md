# MoonPhases-Image-Recognition
This image recognition project predicts the phase of the moon based off of an image. All images have been gathered from my very own backyard through my own telescope. Being an enjoyer of astronomy and the moon, I am glad I can join two of my hobbies together in this passion project. 

Because of the location of the moon during specific times while each of its phases are present, I was not able to capture some images of some of the phases. Using images from the internet I am mixing the large amount of my images with some images of the other phases.
