# MoonPhases-Image-Recognition
This image recognition project predicts the phase of the moon based off of an image. All images have been gathered from my very own backyard through my own telescope. Being an enjoyer of astronomy and the moon, I am glad I can join to of my hobbies together in this passion project.
